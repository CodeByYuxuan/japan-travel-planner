## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and specify the following environment variable:

```
PORT=3000
```

You can change the port number as needed.

### Running the Server

To start the server, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will run the server using Nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.

### Verifying the Server

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a message indicating that the server is working.
